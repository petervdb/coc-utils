# coc-utils

The purpose of this repository is to create a set of scripts written in PHP, Perl or Python to retrieve information from the API site of Clash Of Clans
For the time being you can only find some sample scripts written in PHP to work on SQlite tables.

Requirements to work with the scripts
-------------------------------------
PHP with Curl and SQLite3 support
Bash

To connect to the API using PHP I have used the following tools:
